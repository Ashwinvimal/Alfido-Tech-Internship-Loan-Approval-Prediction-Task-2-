📊 Loan Approval Prediction – Full Project Description

📝 Overview

The Loan Approval Prediction project aims to predict whether a loan should be approved or not based on historical application data. By applying machine learning techniques, this project helps automate the loan evaluation process, saving time and improving accuracy for financial institutions.

📚 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about loan applicants and includes the following features:

Gender – Male or Female

Married – Yes or No

Dependents – Number of dependents

Credit_History – 1 (good), 0 (poor)

Property_Area – Urban, Semiurban, Rural

Loan_Status – Target variable (Y = Approved, N = Not Approved)

🔍 Project Workflow

1.Data Cleaning – Handle missing and inconsistent values

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize patterns and relationships

3.Feature Engineering – Encode categorical data and scale numerical features

4.Model Building – Train ML models like:

5.Logistic Regression

6.Decision Tree

7.Random Forest

8.Support Vector Machine

9.Evaluation – Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance

10.Prediction – Classify new loan applications as Approved or Not Approved
